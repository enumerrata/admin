OpenOakland is dedicated to providing a supportive, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

We expect participants to follow these guidelines at all OpenOakland-hosted events.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any OpenOakland event.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Brigade organizers and event facilitators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Brigade organizer or event facilitator immediately. (While all of our organizers and facilitators are ready to help, please let them know if you would prefer to be assisted by someone of your own gender / gender identity.) Contact information is listed below.

Brigade organizers and event facilitators will eagerly help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

We value your participation in our community.
